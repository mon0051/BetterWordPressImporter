The jquery file is just there for my ide to read, so it doens't complain when i call jquery inline.
The actual version of jquery used is the standard wordpress one, i call no methods that have undergone major changes recently,
so it's quite stable in most environments. Ideally i would like to enforce the use of a specific version, but the way that
wordpress works it's quite difficult to do that without breaking other plugins and themes the require another version.
