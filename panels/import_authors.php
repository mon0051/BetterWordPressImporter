        <p>
            The posts that you are importing already have some authors attached to them.
            This is normal, but because they were exported from another WordPress site, the server can't
            tell if they are related to authors on this WordPress site, or if they are new authors.
        </p>

        <p>
            So what we need to do now is to choose how to deal with these authors.
            By default, they will be imported as new WordPress users, but you can choose to
            associate the users with a local WordPress user instead.
